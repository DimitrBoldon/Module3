## Description

Motivation was to the test my own knownlege on javascrip and test the limations
Starting from the ground up, this was as best and i think close to the criteria that i can make it.
I did have a few problems setting things up, amd im sad to admit i just cant figure out the last part of setting up the math.random
I learn more javascript techniques even with not figuring it out i still learn more than i have before
